                <h1 class="txt">How Harry Potter changed the world</h1>
                <p class='txt'>
                    Almost exactly 20 years ago, on September 1, 1998, Scholastic published Harry Potter and the
                    Sorcerer’s
                    Stone, the first US edition of the UK’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.

                    Harry Potter has since became such an all-encompassing phenomenon that from this vantage point, it’s
                    hard to
                    see the full scope what it accomplished: It feels as though publishing and fandom and children’s
                    literature
                    and all of pop culture have always been the way we know them today. But Harry Potter changed the
                    world.

                    Author J.K. Rowling was an unknown single mom when she first got the idea for her story while stuck
                    on a
                    train; the small UK children’s press that ultimately took a chance on it undoubtedly couldn’t have
                    predicted
                    that it would have a measurable effect on everything it touched. Harry Potter made YA book-to-movie
                    franchises into one of the biggest forces in pop culture. It changed the business model for
                    publishing books
                    for kids. And it introduced an entire generation to the idea that it’s possible to interact with the
                    pop
                    culture you love — to write about it and with it, to make music and art about it, and to build a
                    business
                    around it.

                    Here’s a look back at the way Harry Potter changed and influenced online fandom, millennial culture,
                    and the
                    publishing industry.

                    <h1 class="txt">Why adults got so obsessed with the Harry Potter books</h1>
                    <p class='txt'>
                        A 2012 study found that 55 percent of YA novels are bought by adults. In large part, that boom
                        is courtesy of Harry Potter, which became a surprise crossover hit adored by both children and
                        adults, and which made it acceptable for adults to read books that are ostensibly for children.

                        For some critics, that’s a worrisome development, suggesting that adults are too dull and stupid
                        to appreciate books actually written for adults. But there are plenty of reasons for a grown
                        person to enjoy Harry Potter.

                        The Harry Potter books combine the intricate plotting of a mystery with the sweep and scope of
                        epic fantasy and the intimacy and character development of a classic boarding school narrative.
                        The result is purely pleasurable to read at any age: The puzzlebox mystery plotting keeps the
                        pages turning propulsively forward, the fantastic mythology gives the world scope and magic and
                        joy, and the boarding school structure makes the characters warm and familiar and charming. It
                        also makes their eventual death (for some) and trauma (for all) deeply affecting.
